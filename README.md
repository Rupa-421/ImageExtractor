##### Note:

* It will be good to run in syder as it's related to displaying images. So **ipywidgets** should be removed.
* If there is no availability of spyder you can keep the code as it is.

#### Prerequisites
*Before you continue, ensure you have met the following requirements:*

* You have installed the latest version of jupyter notebook or spyder.
* You have a basic understanding of request module in python.
