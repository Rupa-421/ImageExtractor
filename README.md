# ImageExtractor

> Extract and display images by website link.
 > When we input a link of website it filters all images and displays it one at a time.
  
 This project uses request,opencv,scikit-image and ipywidgets modules.
  

#### Note:

* It will be good to run in syder as it's related to displaying images. So **ipywidgets** should be removed.
* If there is no availability of spyder you can keep the code as it is.

### Prerequisites
*Before you continue, ensure you have met the following requirements:*

* You have installed the latest version of jupyter notebook or spyder.
* You have a basic understanding of request module in python.

### What i have done :

* Getting the source code of website and extracting the links of image.
* Then i displayed the image by using opencv module you can also use pillow.
* In this code i used website of [swiggy](https://www.swiggy.com/) and i got the output of images on that website which you can see in the [outputimages](Output_images) folder of [this](https://github.com/Rupa-421/ImageExtractor) repo.
